# Collatz-Conjecture-Plotter
Python Collatz conjecture graph plotter using matplotlib

<b>Operation instructions</b>:
 - "Enter max amount of instructions" prevents the program from executed too much on higher numbers, set to -1 to disable
 - "Enter max amount of times program will plot 4,2,1 loop" eventually all of the numbers you input will loop in a 4,2,1 pattern recommended 1
 - "Input x value for 3x+1" input the first value you want to be the x in 3x+1
 - "Enter amount of graphs" when set to more than one, after the first graph is plotted, the program will increment x by 1 and plot another graph, the amount of times this is done is dictated by what value you set this
